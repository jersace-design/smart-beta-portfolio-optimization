# Portfolio Optimization

### Overview
Created two portfolios using smart beta methodology and optimization. 

I evaluated the performance of my two portfolios calculating tracking errors; calculated the turnover of 
my portfolio and found the best timing to rebalance. I came up with the portfolio weights by analyzing 
fundamental data and quadratic programming.
